      Leave blank unless using a python or conda virtual environment. For
      a python virtual environment, you must specify the absolute path.
      For a python virtual environment, any packages built in the environment
      will take precedence over those from the Lmod modules. Any virtual
      environment used should have been built from the same Python or Anaconda
      Lmod module selected above.

      Note that if you are using your own collection of modules, this collection
      must result in a valid jupyter executable in your path or the app will
      not function. If set, this field should be the name of your collection
      specified in the "module save" command. If a custom module collection is
      used, then the "Python version" selection will have no effect.
