      Leave blank unless using a virtual environment. To find your

      For a python virtual environment, any packages built in the environment
      Note that your python virtual environment is assumed to be fully
      independent of the provided Lmod-based software stack and no modules
      will be loaded. Your environment must include jupyter.
