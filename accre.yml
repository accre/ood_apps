title: "ACCRE Desktop"
description: |
  This app will launch an interactive desktop on an ACCRE compute node. You
  will have full access to the resources this node provide. This is analogous
  to an interctive batch job. While your desktop may sometimes be available
  within a few seconds, it may spend a few minutes or hours in the scheduler
  queue until resources become available. To ensure that a desktop is ready
  when you need it, we suggest starting the desktop a day in advance, and
  requesting up to a weeks worth of hours. An ACCRE desktop will persist
  between portal sessions until you delete or logout, so you may use the same
  desktop for several days.

      Check this box if you wish to run your job on a custom gateway
      node instead of a standard compute node. You must be a member of
      a group that has an OnDemand enabled custom gateway to use this
      feature. If you wish to have OnDemand enabled on your group's
      custom gateway, please open a helpdesk ticket. If this box is
      checked, then you must enter the name of your custom gateway
      above.
