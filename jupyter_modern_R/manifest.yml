  This app will launch a Jupyter Notebook server on a production
  compute node.

  By default the python environment and interpreter will be loaded from
  the latest <a><href='https://help.accre.vanderbilt.edu/index.php?title=R9_Software_Stack'>
  software stack</a> standard environment provided by the  Digital Research Alliance of Canada
  (the Alliance aka Compute Canada). Unless your project has specific versioning requirements,
  we strongly suggest selecting the latest version of R, Python, and Scipy-Stack.

  If you need additional python packages you may add any that you need that are available
  from the <a href='https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/Available_Python_wheels'>Compute Canada Wheelhouse</a>.
  You may also provide the path to a python requirements file rather than listing
  each package separately.

  Alternatively, if you have a python virtual environment that is fully independent
  from the provided software stack, you may use that instead by selecting the option
  to bring your own virtual environment.
