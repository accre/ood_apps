name: Singularity Jupyter Notebook (GPU) (Beta)
category: Interactive Apps
subcategory: Servers
role: batch_connect
description: |
  This app will launch a Jupyter Notebook server on a production 
  GPU node using a user-provided Singularity Container.

  The container provided must be able to execute "jupyter notebook"
  in order for this app to function. Note that ${HOME}/.local will
  be bind-mounted to a temporary directory so that user installed
  kernels outside of the container will not interfere with those
  installed inside the container. As a result of this, deleting
  notebooks may not be possible from the jupyter interface with
  this app.
