title: "[legacy] ACCRE Desktop"
description: |
  NOTICE - This is a legacy application left available temporarily for
  compatibility with existing workflows. We recommend that you use the
  new ACCRE Desktop app instead as soon as is practical.

  This app will launch an interactive desktop on an ACCRE compute node. You
  will have full access to the resources this node provide. This is analogous
  to an interactive batch job. While your desktop may sometimes be available
  within a few seconds, it may spend a few minutes or hours in the scheduler
  queue until resources become available. To ensure that a desktop is ready
  when you need it, we suggest starting the desktop a day in advance, and
  requesting up to a weeks worth of hours. An ACCRE desktop will persist
  between portal sessions until you delete or logout, so you may use the same
  desktop for several days.
