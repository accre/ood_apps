title: "ACCRE GPU Desktop (Legacy)"
description: |
  NOTICE - This is a legacy application left available temporarily for
  compatibility with existing workflows. We recommend that you use the
  new ACCRE Desktop app instead as soon as is practical. Note that at
  present this app is still required to access the DGX hardware as we
  are still setting up a permanent resource access structure for these
  machines.
  
  This is an experimental feature!!! This app will launch an interactive
  desktop on an ACCRE GPU node. You must have GPU access to use this app.
