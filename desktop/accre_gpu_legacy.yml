title: "[legacy] ACCRE GPU Desktop"
description: |
  NOTICE - This is a legacy application left available temporarily for
  compatibility with existing workflows. We recommend that you use the
  new ACCRE Desktop app instead as soon as is practical.
  
  This is an experimental feature!!! This app will launch an interactive
  desktop on an ACCRE GPU node. You must have GPU access to use this app.
