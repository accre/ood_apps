title: "ACCRE Desktop"
description: |
  This app will launch an interactive desktop on an ACCRE compute node. You
  will have full access to the resources this node provide. This is analogous
  to an interactive batch job. While your desktop may sometimes be available
  within a few seconds, it may spend a few minutes or hours in the scheduler
  queue until resources become available. To ensure that a desktop is ready
  when you need it, we suggest starting the desktop a day in advance, and
  requesting up to a weeks worth of hours. An ACCRE desktop will persist
  between portal sessions until you delete or logout, so you may use the same
  desktop for several days.

  NOTICE - for access to the DGX hardware, please use the legacy ACCRE GPU
  for now as we are still working on a permanent resource management structure
  for this hardware.

      Leave blank to use your default slurm account.
      To get a list of slurm accounts
      and resources that your user has access to, connect to a gateway node and
      run the "slurm_resources" command. Note that your specified account must
      have access the partition, and possibly qos and gpu resources specified

      to GPUs select the batch_gpu partition. To get a list of slurm accounts

      physical CPU cores reserved for your job will be automatically set to a proportion
      of the resources available on the node per GPU card.
